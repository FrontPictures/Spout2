[Spout](http://spout.zeal.co/)

This branch is a complete archive of Spout Version 2.006.

The SDK files and libraries can be used for maintenance or development of existing applications. They remain compatible with those built with the 2.007 SDK.

Spout 2.006 has support for DirectX 9 textures which has been removed in Version 2.007. Memoryshare mode has also been removed, but 2.007 receivers will still receive from 2.006 memoryshare senders. CPU share mode is compatible.

Installations, SpoutCam, SpoutSettings, SpoutPanel and the Max/Msp plugins in this branch should not be used.

The FreeframeGL plugins are compatible where the host supports FreeframeGL 1.6.

The Winamp Milkdrop plugin can also be used but a better alternative [NestDrop](http://nestimmersion.ca/nestdrop.html) is avalable.

For general questions please visit the [Spout Discourse group](https://spout.discourse.group)

Your support will help the project to continue and develop.
